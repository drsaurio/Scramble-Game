# Scramble-Game
Playing with some Ajax and Photoshop.
This is just a simple game created with some AJAX requests. On my original website sample (no responsive) you will see a cat playing with
a ball. Probably you don't have any idea about Adobe Flash, but this will remind some people about that obsolete web technology.
The trick: I use an animate.gif ( Built on Photoshop) and some free web fonts.
